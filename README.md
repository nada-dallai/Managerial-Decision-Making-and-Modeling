A University project from the course "Managerial Decision Making and Modelling" helped us pave our first steps into the managerial problems and their optimization methods. 
Here's how it went:
1. We looked up a Bank's marketing campaign' database that's open source and that we can use for information extraction + scenario development
2. We made key assumptions about the variables of the database and did some cleaning
3. We then built 4 hypothetical scenarios that would put the Bank's Marketing team in a challenging situation where they have to make timely decisions about the next steps while considering a group of constraints limiting their freedom.
4. Then we developed a mathematical model for each of those scenarios
5. Finally, we started encoding the scenarios' solutions using Python and its Pulp library that helps generate an LP solution for each scenario.
I deeply appreciate the work done by our professor, my teammates, and myself on this project, for although it is far from being perfect, it bridged the gap between my theoretical knowledge of how to solve simple LP problems, and how to resolve them in fewer and simpler steps using Python.
