        "This report is done as a part of the completion of the MDMM project to document the work that has been done by the group members. The purpose is to tackle an existing problem using data to optimize a real-life problem while using the methods and knowledge acquired during the course. The data chosen was taken from the following website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing. <br>\n",
        "It is data of marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution and has information that is:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Demographic (linked to age, job, marital status, etc.)\n",
        "*   Customers' Banking history (default history, debt situation, yearly balance)\n",
        "*   Last marketing campaign information (days from last contact of individual, contact type, duration of the calls in that last contact, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Methodology:** <br>\n",
        "To tackle the problem, we had to first look at the problem from a marketing department point of view and decide what is the ultimate goal and objective of the study, which is to **maximize the number of term deposits of the bank**. We then decided on the **multiple scenarios** to include and wrote the **mathematical model**. <br>\n",
        "We then developed the **Python code** using **PuLP library** meant to solve LP, IP or MILP decision problems. <br>\n",
        "Between each of the mentioned steps our professor **Raffaele Pesenti** helped us formalize the problem and discuss the mathematical models to make sure they are correct. In total 3 meetings were organized before scheduling the presentation date.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Results:** <br>\n",
        "As a result we had developed four different scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Scenario 1 : The decision-maker must decide which clients to contact from each category based on previous contact history.\n",
        "*   Scenario 2: The decision-maker must Decide on the appropriate channels to contact clients based on the conversion rate of each of the channels and the budgets associated with them.\n",
        "*   Scenario 3 : The decision-maker must decide on the best period to contact each client based on the expected periods that have a higher expected yield than the others.\n",
        "*   Scenario 4 : The decision-maker must decide the best type of subcategory of clients to target in his next campaign, and the number of clients of each subcategory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Conclusion:** <br>\n",
        "In scenario 1, we ended up with the optimal result of 2949 out of 8646 clients with detailing which clients must be contacted based on our contact history to avoid annoying clients with successive calling.\n",
        "\n",
        "In scenario 2, from the four presented options: TV, Print, email and phone marketing TV got discarded because of its high cost and low return. the result depicts which channels must be selected based on their appeal to clients; Email and phone calls got the most number of clients with Print marketing coming in second. This will help the decsion maker rationalize on which channels are most adequate for a bank marketing campaign and thus prioritizing the channels that will yield the highest return.\n",
        "\n",
        "In scenario 3, we are presented with three periods: high, moderate and low season. on which we divided a number of people out of our client list based on budget and frequency constraints over the three periods. Period 1 and 2 got the most out of them with 3000 in each due to increased financial activity\n",
        "\n",
        "In scenario 4, we seek more effiecient targeting by further segmenting our clients and discovering which ones to to contact from each marital status/educational level combinations of different clients resulting in six types of clients with the optimal number to contact from each one. results indicate that we should mainly opt for married people with high level of education because they have higher fiancial literacy and stability."

        "**TV Marketing (0 clients):**\n",
        " The model suggests not targeting any clients through TV marketing. This could be due to various reasons such as high costs associated with TV advertising, limited audience reach or effectiveness in this particular scenario, or the audience demographics not aligning with the target market for term deposit subscriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:** TV marketing might not be the most suitable channel for promoting term deposit subscriptions due to its broad reach and potentially higher costs compared to other channels. Additionally, the target audience for term deposit subscriptions might not be effectively reached through TV advertising.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Print Marketing (500 clients):**\n",
        "The model recommends targeting 500 clients through print marketing. This suggests that print media, such as newspapers or magazines, could be an effective channel for reaching a segment of the target audience interested in term deposit subscriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:** Print marketing might be effective for reaching specific demographic segments or local communities where print media consumption is still prevalent. Additionally, print materials can provide detailed information about term deposit offerings, making them suitable for audiences seeking in-depth financial information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Email Marketing (1000 clients):**\n",
        "Targeting 1000 clients through email marketing indicates that this channel is highly effective in reaching potential subscribers for term deposits. Email marketing offers a cost-effective way to deliver personalized messages and engage with a large audience.\n",
        "Possible\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:** Email marketing allows for targeted communication, personalized offers, and easy tracking of engagement metrics. It can be particularly effective for reaching tech-savvy individuals or those who prefer digital communication channels for financial matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phone Calls (1000 clients):**\n",
        "Targeting 1000 clients through phone calls suggests that direct communication remains a valuable strategy for promoting term deposit subscriptions. Phone calls enable personalized interaction and immediate response to queries or concerns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:** Phone calls provide an opportunity for direct engagement with potential clients, allowing for personalized pitches, addressing objections, and building rapport. This channel can be effective for converting leads into term deposit subscribers through persuasive communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Implications:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The results suggest that while TV marketing might not be suitable for this campaign, print marketing, email marketing, and phone calls are effective channels for reaching potential term deposit subscribers.\n",
        "Print and email marketing are particularly effective in reaching a larger number of clients, while phone calls offer personalized interaction for higher conversion rates.\n",
        "The allocation of clients across different channels reflects a strategic approach to maximize the campaign's effectiveness while optimizing resource utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-World Applications of the model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Channel Diversification:** By exploring various marketing channels like TV, Print, Email, and Phone calls, the decision-maker ensures broader reach and exposure to different audience segments. This diversification can enhance brand visibility and attract a more diverse clientele.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cost Management:** Each channel has associated costs, and the model ensures that the marketing campaign stays within the allocated budget for each channel. This prevents overspending and optimizes resource allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Client Targeting:** The model determines the most effective channels for reaching different client segments. For instance:\n",
        "TV marketing might be effective for reaching a broad audience but could be costly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Print marketing could be targeted towards specific demographics or local communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Email marketing offers a cost-effective way to reach a large audience, especially for personalized communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Phone calls enable direct and interactive communication with potential clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Maximizing Subscription:** By optimizing the distribution of clients across different channels, the model maximizes the potential for term deposit subscriptions. This ensures a higher return on investment for the marketing campaign.\n",
        "Adaptability: The model's flexibility allows for adjustments based on changing market conditions, audience preferences, and budget considerations. For example, if one channel proves to be less effective, resources can be reallocated to more promising channels.\n",
        "Evaluation and Iteration: After implementing the model's recommendations, the decision-maker can evaluate the campaign's performance and iterate the strategy for continuous improvement. This iterative approach enhances the campaign's effectiveness over time.\n",
        "Overall, the model's solutions provide actionable insights for designing and executing a multi-channel marketing campaign aimed at maximizing term deposit subscriptions while optimizing resource utilization and client engagement."

The model suggests targeting the highest number of clients during the high season(Period 1), which aligns with the expectation that clients might be more receptive to term deposit offers during these periods due to increased financial activity such as year-end bonuses, holiday spending, and tax planning. In second place comes Period 2 which is a moderate season with a less but still significant financial activity. Finally the low season (Period 3) with 2121 targeted clients that represents the minimum in this optimization problem.\n",

        "**Optimal Targeting:** The optimization model, when applied to the defined customer categories, provides insights into the most effective demographics for targeting marketing campaigns. By considering probabilities of subscription and other parameters, the model suggests targeting specific demographics more intensively, maximizing the likelihood of successful conversions. For example, the model might recommend targeting married individuals with a college education over other demographics due to their higher probability of subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constraints Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "**Budget Allocation:** Through the incorporation of budget constraints, the model ensures that marketing efforts remain within financial bounds. By considering the costs associated with contacting individuals in each demographic category, the model optimizes resource allocation to maximize the campaign's effectiveness while staying within the predefined budget. This ensures efficient utilization of financial resources and prevents overspending.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Default History Constraint:** The optimization model incorporates a constraint to limit the defaulted balance of defaulters within each demographic subcategory. By multiplying the number of targeted customers in each subcategory by the corresponding default indicator ($DF_{jk}$), the model ensures that the total defaulted balance does not exceed the predefined maximum threshold for each subcategory. This constraint helps mitigate the risk associated with targeting individuals with a history of defaults and ensures that the marketing campaign maintains a balanced approach to risk management across different demographic segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Duration per Category Constraint:** The optimization model imposes a constraint to limit the duration of calls made by the marketing department on each demographic subcategory (jk). By multiplying the number of targeted customers in each subcategory by the duration of a call in that subcategory ($D_{jk}$), the model ensures that the total duration of calls does not exceed the predefined maximum duration for each subcategory. This constraint helps manage the overall time spent on marketing calls effectively, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently across different demographic segments while respecting operational limits for call durations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Minimum Individuals Constraint:** The optimization model enforces a constraint to ensure that each demographic subcategory related to marital status ($j$) includes a minimum number of targeted individuals. By summing the number of targeted customers across both levels of college attendance ($k$) within each marital status category, the model ensures that the total number of targeted individuals meets or exceeds the predefined minimum threshold for that category. This constraint guarantees that each marital status category receives sufficient attention in the marketing campaign, promoting inclusivity and diversity in targeting strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimization model has found an **optimal solution** with an objective value of approximately *193.51*. This objective value represents the maximum sum of the product of the decision variables (Tjk) and the corresponding probabilities (Pjk), as defined in the objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The decision variables represent the **number of customers chosen from each subcategory jk**, where:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   T_(1,1) = 131.0: Number of customers chosen from the divorced category with college education.\n",
        "*   T_(1,2) = 146.0: Number of customers chosen from the divorced category without college education.\n",
        "*   T_(2,1) = 1169.0: Number of customers chosen from the married category with college education.\n",
        "*   T_(2,2) = 773.0: Number of customers chosen from the married category without college education.\n",

        "*   T_(3,2) = 413.0: Number of customers chosen from the single category without college education.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Possible Explanations:**\n",
        "*   **Probability Distribution:** The optimal solution reflects a strategic allocation of resources based on the probabilities of subscription associated with each subcategory. It appears that the model has prioritized targeting customers from the married category, particularly those with college education, as they have higher probabilities of subscription compared to other categories.\n",
        "*   **Resource Utilization:** The model has effectively utilized the available resources, such as budget and manpower, to maximize the overall return on investment (ROI) for the marketing campaign. By targeting a larger number of customers from the married category, where the likelihood of subscription is higher, the model aims to achieve a balance between maximizing potential returns and optimizing resource allocation.\n",
        "*   **Constraints Satisfaction:** The optimal solution satisfies all constraints imposed on the problem, including budget constraints, default history constraints, duration per category constraints, and minimum individuals constraints. This indicates that the solution is feasible and complies with the specified limitations and requirements of the problem.\n",
        "*   **Demographic Considerations:** The solution may also reflect demographic trends or characteristics of the target audience. For instance, the model may have identified certain demographic groups within the married category, such as individuals with college education, as being more receptive to the marketing campaign, leading to a higher allocation of resources to this segment."
